<ul>
<li>Lichen sclerosus (LS) is the preferred term for what was previously known as balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO).</li>
<li>Lichen sclerosus is a <strong>chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin of uknown origin.</strong> The glans penis and foreskin are usually affected.</li>
<li>LS is a scarring disorder characterized by tissue pallor, loss of architecture and hyperkeratosis.</li>
<li>Incidence of LS in the western population is 1 in 300.</li>
<li>LS is 6 to 10 times more prevalent in women than in men, generally presenting around the time of menopause.</li>
<li>In men, LS seems to peak between the ages of 30 to 50; but it may occur in all ages; from infants to the elderly.</li>
<li>LS is commonly found at the time of circumcision when performed beyond the neonatal period.</li>
<li><strong>LS is the most common cause of meatal stenosis, appears as a whitish plaque that may involve the prepuce, glans penis, urethral meatus and fossa navicularis. If only the foreskin is involved, circumcision may be curative</strong>.</li>
<li>LS usually begins as a meatal or perimeatal process in the circumcised patient but it may involve other areas of the preputial space in the uncircumcised patient.</li>
<li>In uncircumcised men, the prepuce becomes edematous and thickened, and often may be adherent to the glans.</li>
<li>The peak ages of recognition in women are bimodal, with many cases noted before puberty but with another peak presenting in postmenopausal women.</li>
<li><span class="text-success">BXO= m/c cause of strictures of fossa navicularis and penile urethra, starts at glans and preputial skin, causing meatal stenosis and/or phimosis.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-success">Urethral stricture occur due to inflammation or infection of the periurethral glands of Litter (“Littritis”) secondary to high pressure voiding related to meatal stenosis &#x26; perhaps microabscesses and deep spongiofibrosis.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-success">Panurethral stricture can also occur in BXO.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="etiology"><code>Etiology:</code></h3>
<p>No specific mechanism has been elucidated, possibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoimmune disease</li>
<li>Reactive oxidative stress contributed to the sclerotic, immunologic and carcinogenic process in LS.</li>
<li>Infections (chronic infection by a spirochete, <code>Borrelia burgdorferi</code>).</li>
<li><code>Koebner phenomenon</code> relates the development of LS to trauma to an affected area.</li>
<li>Genetic origin, based on the observation of a familial distribution of cases.</li>
<li>Concomitant existence of the disease in identical twins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="diagnosis"><code>Diagnosis:</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Diagnosis is made through biopsy.</li>
<li>LS has specific histologic features, including-
<ul>
<li>Basal cell vacuolation</li>
<li>Epidermal atrophy</li>
<li>Dermal edema</li>
<li>Collagen homogenization</li>
<li>Focal perivascular infiltrate of the papillary dermis</li>
<li>Plugging of the ostia of follicular and eccrine structures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="management"><code>Management:</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>The combination of <code>topical steroids and antibiotics</code> may help stabilize the inflammatory process.</li>
<li>Conservative therapy may be warranted in patients whose meatus can easily be maintained at 14 to 16 French.
<ul>
<li>In these cases, intermittent catheterization with lubrication of the catheter</li>
<li>and meatal dilator with 0.05% clobetasol (brand name Temovate) for 3 months may be adequate treatment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Long-term antibiotic (Tetracycline, erythromycin, penicillin) therapy</code> may also be helpful to improve the inflammation, because secondary infection of the inflamed tissue may occur.</li>
<li>A recent European, multicenter, phase II trial also supported the safety and efficacy of <code>topical tacrolimus</code> in the treatment of long standing LS.</li>
<li><strong>In young patients with severe meatal stenosis, surgery is indicated. Because patients with long-standing meatal stenosis often have severe proximal urethral stricture disease, retrograde urethrography should be performed before the initiation of therapy.</strong></li>
<li>Long-standing cases with a long length of urethral stricture are amenable to techniques of reconstruction but are very challenging.</li>
<li>It is becoming clear that except in the case of urethral stricture disease confined only to the meatus and fossa navicularis, <code>staged oral graft (buccal mucosal graft-BMG) reconstruction</code>, at least in the short to mid term, seems to provide superior durable results.</li>
<li>In some patients with severe urethral stricture disease, ideal treatment is <code>perineal urethrostomy</code>.</li>
